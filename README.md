This deep learning based solution provides chest CT analysis with precise segmentation of various anomalies and chest conditions.

## Product Overview
Customized Chest CT Anomaly Segmentation is an advanced deep learning solution specifically designed for chest CT-scan diagnosis. The solution utilizes state-of-the-art biomedical segmentation deep learning models and frameworks. It performs semantic segmentation on a wide range of chest anomalies and conditions, including tumors, infections, and lung diseases. This solution automates chest CT segmentation, reduces diagnosis time and aids in early detection and treatment planning.

## Product Highlight 

* Understand the anomaly or other chest condition and perform segmentation on a much larger set of unlabelled samples.maximizing relavancy and minimizing redudancy among features. Using this crucial component of machine learning, user's can eliminate the need of classical alternative feature selection methods like recursive feature selection and incorporate this one shot solution.
* The solution is  equipped with the capbility of precisely performing fine grained segmentation i.e sparsely labels where only a small and disburse parts of CT scan images is of interest. Our solution is recommended to be used as an assistant to the health care practitioners for large volume of data.
